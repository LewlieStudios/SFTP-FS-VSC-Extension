## ðŸ”¹ 1.2.1

* Hotfix: Fixed an issue when deleting a file or folder that causes the file or folder to reappear in the file explorer after deletion, this was a visual bug because the file already was removed from the SFTP server.

## ðŸ”¹ 1.2.0

* Improvement: Added a cache to store directories content, this will improve some file operations like: renaming a file, create a file, create a directory, delete a file/directory.
* Added: Added contextual action "SFTP Dir: Refresh directory content" to refresh the content of a directory, use this action when you have made changes to a directory from SFTP server and you want to see the changes in the file explorer.
* Feature: Changed minimum version of engine to 1.93.0, this will allow extensions to work with VSCode 1.93.0 and above.

## ðŸ”¹ 1.1.2

* Improvement: Validation of SFTP connection is now done after 60 seconds to speed-up SFTP operations on SFTP servers with high latency.
* Improvement: Directories are now cached when required and not on every SFTP operation to speed-up STP operations on SFTP servers with high latency.

## ðŸ”¹ 1.1.1

* Improvement: Added validation to SFTP connections to check if connection is still valid before any SFTP operation, if connection is not valid a new connection is created and the previous connection is removed from the pool of connections.

## ðŸ”¹ 1.1.0

* Fixed: When uploading files to the remote server, folder was always uploaded with a lowercase name regardless if folder name contained uppercase and lowercase letters. This has been fixed, and uploads are now handled correctly.
* Feature: A file metadata cache was added to improve upload and download times for multiple files without needing to query the remote server for already know metadata. Setting `sftpfs.cache.metadata.files.seconds` has been added to control this behavior.
* Feature: Implemented contextual menu actions "SFTP File Sync: 1. Remote â†’ Local (download)" and "SFTP File Sync: 2. Local â†’ Remote (upload)" to download/upload a single file from/to remote server.
* Improvement: The "Reveal in File Explorer" action has been improved; it now selects the file in system file explorer.
* Improvement: Files uploaded via VSCode file explorer now uses the setting `sftpfs.behavior.notification.upload.fileSize` to display a progressive notification when a file is uploaded.
